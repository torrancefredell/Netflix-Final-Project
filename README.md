# Netflix-Final-Project
Netflix data final project
In this project, I used Netflix TV Shows and Movies data to create an ETL process to Extract, Transform and Load multiple datasets from CSV Files into a MongoDB Database. After that, I used that data source to create a simple chatbot which allows the user to as a variety of questions to the chatbot. My bot answers the questions (taking note to use various forms of ways to ask the question) in a human type of form.
